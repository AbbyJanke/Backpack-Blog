## Change log

Coming Soon..

## Overwriting functionality

If you need to modify how this works in a project:
- create a ```routes/backpack/blog.php``` file; the package will see that, and load _your_ routes file, instead of the one in the package;
- create controllers/models that extend the ones in the package, and use those in your new routes file;
- modify anything you'd like in the new controllers/models;
